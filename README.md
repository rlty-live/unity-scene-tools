## Configure access
  ## On Windows
 - Find or create the `.upmconfig.toml` file (see https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-config-scoped.html#upmconfigUser for details). On Windows, it is in `%USERPROFILE%\.upmconfig.toml`.
 - Add the token in the file like this:

  ```
  [npmAuth."https://npm.pkg.github.com/@rlty-live"]
  token = "<the new token>"
  ```

  ## On MacOS
  To create  .upconfig.toml  on mac:
  ".xxx" files cannot be created via Finder because these name formats are reserved for system files.

  To create them you have to use the Terminal:
  - Cmd + Space : Terminal

  In the terminal paste the following commands (without "")
  - 'cd /etc'                 (to access the global user folder)
  - 'touch .upconfig.toml'    (to create the file)
  - 'open .upmconfig.toml'    (to open it)
  You can also find it in finder by displaying the hidden files in finder options.
  
  ## On Both
  - Add the token in the file like this:
  ```
  [npmAuth."https://npm.pkg.github.com/@rlty-live"]
  token = "<the new token>"
  ```

 - Close all Unity Editor instance.
 - Configure the scope registry. You can do it from the Unity Editor (`Edit -> Project Settings`):

    ...
  },
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "RLTY",
      "url": "https://npm.pkg.github.com/@rlty-live",
      "scopes": [
        "live.rlty"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note üìù:** when browsing unity package manager, you will always get an error:
```
[Package Manager Window] Cannot perform upm operation: Unable to perform online search:
  Request [GET https://npm.pkg.github.com/@rlty-live/-/v1/search?text=live.rlty&from=0&size=250] failed with status code [405] [NotFound].
```
This is because GitHub doesn't have an API to get package list. You should ignore this error.
